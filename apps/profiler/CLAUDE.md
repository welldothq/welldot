# apps/profiler — Welldot (Nuxt 4)

**Active production app.** This is the replacement for `apps/well-profiler`. Built with Nuxt 4 + Vue 3, deployed to Cloudflare Workers at `welldot.org`.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Nuxt 4 (`srcDir: app/`) with SSR enabled
- **UI:** PrimeVue 4 + `@welldot/vue` (workspace package, see [packages/vue/CLAUDE.md](../../packages/vue/CLAUDE.md)) — base components (`Well*`), the PrimeVue theme (`WelldotPreset` + `welldotPt` pass-through) and the Tailwind tokens. Wired by the `@welldot/vue/nuxt` module
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4 (Vite plugin), global styles in `app/assets/styles/main.css`
- **State:** Pinia with `pinia-plugin-persistedstate`
- **i18n:** `@nuxtjs/i18n` — English and Brazilian Portuguese (`i18n/locales/`)
- **SEO:** `@nuxtjs/seo` (schema.org, OG, sitemap, robots)
- **PWA:** `@vite-pwa/nuxt` (auto-update, disabled in dev)
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Serif, JetBrains Mono (via `@nuxt/fonts`)
- **Icons:** Phosphor (`ph:`) via `@nuxt/icon` — **preferred**. Heroicons (`heroicons:`) remain as secondary usange when there is no phosphor good icon or is explicit said. Custom SVG icons in `app/assets/icons/` (prefix `welldot:`)
- **Onboarding tips:** `driver.js` — startup tips that highlight a UI element (`app/composables/useStartupTips.ts`)
- **Analytics:** first party, no cookies or identifiers. `trackEvent()` (`app/utils/analytics.ts`) beacons product events to `POST /api/events`, which stores them in Supabase `app_events` (see Server routes). In dev it only logs to `console.debug`. Events: `well_new`, `well_open` (`source`: file/drop/paste/siagas/example/share), `well_save` (`method`), `siagas_import` (`status`), `pdf_download`, `pdf_print`, `share_link`. A new event needs its name in `ANALYTICS_EVENTS` (`shared/utils/analytics.ts`) first; the route drops anything else. Never put well data or personal data in params
- **Deploy:** Cloudflare Workers (Nitro `cloudflare-module` preset, static assets binding); preview via `wrangler dev`

                             Tab keys are semantic (`EDITOR_TAB` in summary/navigate.ts) and
                             the active one is kept in the URL hash (`/editor#permits`,
                             none for summary); `profileStore.wellSession` (bumped by
                             `loadWell`/`clear`) sends the editor back to the summary.

                             read raw and tracked by `readingsVersion`, which every change to
                             `form.readings` must bump). Its "Import CSV" button opens
                             LoggerImportDialog (file/paste, column mapping, live summary from
                             `buildLoggerReadings`), which emits `import`; the dialog merges with

                             drop on the dialog), paste JSON (also any paste in the dialog)
                             and SIAGAS (SiagasPanel: code or link → `/api/siagas/[code]`,

                             code or link anywhere in the dialog opens it). `useNewWellDialog()` holds its state and
                             opens it once per session when the editor starts empty (not
                             with `?share=`); the header "New" button, the canvas empty
                             state and the menu's "Open example" open it, and any
                             `wellSession` bump closes it. `useOpenWellFile()` is the
                             shared open/drop/paste flow (asks before discarding changes;
                             resolves true/false/null = loaded/failed/cancelled, the reason

                             `/examples` (see nuxt.config.ts). `useWellExamples()` fetches
                             `/examples/index.json` and loads a `.well` through
                             `profileStore.loadWell` (asks first when there are unsaved
                             changes). Cards show the generated `examples/thumbs/<slug>.svg`

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # nuxt dev (localhost:3000)
pnpm build      # nuxt build → .output/
pnpm generate   # static generation
pnpm preview    # wrangler dev (Cloudflare Workers preview)
pnpm lint       # eslint
```

## Key patterns

- Nuxt auto-imports components, composables, and `utils/` — no explicit imports needed for those.
- PrimeVue components are auto-imported. Check `welldotPt` (`packages/vue/src/theme/pt.ts`) before adding Tailwind classes to PrimeVue elements.
- **Base components come from `@welldot/vue`** (see [packages/vue/CLAUDE.md](../../packages/vue/CLAUDE.md)). The `@welldot/vue/nuxt` module (in `modules`) registers every `Well*` component, auto-imports `createWelldot` / `useWelldotConfig` / `useWellText` / `useWellUnits` / `useWellNumberFormat`, defaults `primevue.importTheme` / `importPT` to the Welldot theme, and wires the locale from `$i18n`. `plugins/03.welldot.ts` layers the units, coordinate format and the `icon` part on top. The components take plain strings (no i18n inside): pass `t(...)` for every label, including the aria labels (`info-label` / `label` = `t('editor.fieldInfo')`, grid `delete-label` = `t('editor.deleteRow')`, grid `labels` = `{ showPendingTextures, columnInfo }`). Grid column types come from `@welldot/vue/grid` (`WellGridColumn`). Fix base-component bugs in `packages/vue`, never by re-adding app copies.
- Breakpoints are managed by `nuxt-viewport`; prefer `useViewport()` over raw media queries.
- Locale strings live in `i18n/locales/*.json`; use `useI18n().t('key')` in components.
- **Recommended values of open `.well` fields** (permit type, condition category, pump type, materials, sample type, …) come from the `@welldot/core` vocabularies (`PERMIT_TYPES`, `CONSTRUCTION_MATERIALS`, …), never from i18n keys. In components use `useVocab()` — `vocabOptions(VOCAB, current?)` for Select/combo options (deprecated values only when `current`); a field that takes free text besides those options is a `WellComboSelect` with `:hint="t('editor.comboHint')"` (grid `combo` columns: `labels.comboHint`), never a bare `Select editable` and `vocabLabel(VOCAB, value)` / `vocabList(VOCAB, values)` for display; free-text and `x-` values show as-is. PDF export lives in `@welldot/pdf` (see `packages/pdf/CLAUDE.md`), which uses `getVocabLabel(…, locale)` and its own label pack. Always store the key, never the translated label. Closed vocabularies (permit status, well status, qualifiers, …): the value lists come from `@welldot/core` (`WELL_STATUS_VALUES`, `QUALIFIER_VALUES`, …) and the labels from i18n keys, looked up in `utils/*Vocab.ts`. Pure helpers (dates, coordinates, unit labels, readings, permit/meter labels) live in `@welldot/utils`; the app's `utils/*.ts` files only re-export them for auto-import next to the UI-only bits (severity maps, icons). Never re-implement them in the app.
- The `EventBus` in `core/EventBus/` is the preferred pattern for cross-component communication not suited to Pinia.
- **Startup tips:** the editor shows one non-dismissed tip per load (`useStartupTips().showStartupTip()` in `pages/editor/index.vue`). To add a tip: append an entry to the `tips` array in `useStartupTips.ts`, put a matching `data-tip="…"` attribute on the target element, and add `tips.<name>.*` keys to both locales. Dismissed tip ids persist in `uiStore.dismissedTips`; popover styling lives under `.welldot-tip` in `main.css`.

## Server routes & scheduled tasks

- `server/api/` — Nitro API routes. Profile sharing (`share.post.ts`, `share/[id].get.ts`) hashes/stores well JSON in Supabase via `server/utils/supabase.ts` (service-role key, server-only — never exposed to the client). Shares are capped at `MAX_SHARE_BYTES` and expire after `SHARE_TTL_DAYS` (`server/utils/shareConfig.ts`); the GET route edge-caches successful lookups via the Workers Cache API.
- `server/api/siagas/[code].get.ts` imports a well with `importSiagasWell` (`@welldot/utils/siagas`) — the SGB pages have no CORS, so the fetch runs here. Query `rimas` (`none`/`monthly`/`all`) and `media` (`0` to skip). Rate limited by the optional `SIAGAS_RATE_LIMITER` binding (`wrangler.json`) and edge-cached for a day per code + options; `SiagasError.kind` maps to 400/404/502/500, a timeout to 504.
- `server/api/events.post.ts` stores one `trackEvent()` event in Supabase `app_events` (`server/db/app_events.sql`, with example queries): name, params, `cf-ipcountry` country and host. No IP, cookie or user id. Unknown names and params outside `ANALYTICS_LIMITS` get 400. Rate limited by the optional `EVENTS_RATE_LIMITER` binding (`wrangler.json`).
- `server/tasks/` — Nitro scheduled tasks (`experimental.tasks` in `nuxt.config.ts`). `shares:cleanup` (`server/tasks/shares/cleanup.ts`) purges expired `well_shares` rows. Wiring a task requires **both**: a `nitro.scheduledTasks` entry in `nuxt.config.ts` mapping a cron string to the task name, **and** the identical cron string in `wrangler.json`'s `triggers.crons` — Cloudflare only invokes `scheduled()` for crons declared there, and Nitro only runs a task if its cron matches an entry in `scheduledTasks`.
- `getRuntimeEnv`/`getSupabaseClient` (`server/utils/env.ts`, `supabase.ts`) accept a structural `RuntimeEnvSource`, not `H3Event`, specifically so scheduled tasks (which get a Nitro `TaskEvent`, not an `H3Event`) can reuse them.

## Documentation requirements

Update this `CLAUDE.md` when:

- A new Nuxt module is added (Stack section + any config file it introduces)
- A new top-level directory appears under `app/` (Directory layout section)
- A significant pattern changes (state management, i18n, deploy target, theme system)
- A new environment variable is required at build or runtime

`README.md` covers setup, the color system, and PrimeVue usage for human contributors. Keep it in sync when those topics change.

## Color system

Two mirrored scales — `surface` (backgrounds) and `content` (text, borders, icons) — cover all neutral colors. The scales flip between modes so no `dark:` variant is ever needed for neutrals. `primary`, `error`, `warning`, `success`, and `info` handle semantic highlights.

**Pairing rule:** `surface-N` and `content-N` at the same index always contrast, because the scales are inverses. Mixing distant indexes breaks contrast in one mode (`surface-100 + text-content-900` = near-black on near-black in dark mode).

| Scale                        | Role                                                     | Normal range                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `surface`                    | Backgrounds only — never text/icons                      | `0–200`; higher only for intentional inversion                                 |
| `content`                    | Text, borders, icon strokes                              | `0` (body) → `300` (muted) → `600` (subtle border); `800+` almost always wrong |
| `primary`                    | CTAs, active states, focus rings, interactive highlights | varies                                                                         |
| `error/warning/success/info` | State communication                                      | `500` default; `50–100` for bg, `700–800` for text on light bg                 |

Key rules:

- `surface` for backgrounds exclusively; `content` for everything neutral on top of it.
- Pair at the same index. Slight offset toward higher values for hierarchy is fine; a large gap (>400 steps) is a bug.
- High `surface` values (`400+`) signal a deliberate inversion (dark hero, inverted sidebar) — rare. High `content` values (`800+`) are nearly always wrong.
- Tailwind utilities (`bg-surface-*`, `text-content-*`, `bg-primary-*`, etc.) are bridged from the `--w-*` color tokens of `@welldot/vue/tokens.css` (also read by the PrimeVue preset) by `@welldot/vue/tailwind.css`, imported in `app/assets/styles/main.css`. Never use Tailwind grays, raw `bg-white`, or hardcoded hex — they break dark mode.
- Chart series (data marks only, never text) use `--chart-series-1…8` from `main.css`: a categorical palette with its own validated steps per mode (`:root` / `.dark-mode`), assigned in fixed order (`stepColor()` in `hydrodynamicEvents/charts/types.ts`).

## PrimeVue components

Always prefer a PrimeVue component over a hand-rolled one. Customise in this order — stop at the first layer that solves the problem:

1. **API** — props and slots (`primevue.org/<component>`).
2. **`WelldotPreset`** (`packages/vue/src/theme/preset.ts`) — global visual change (design token override under `components`). Right for color, radius, spacing that should apply to every instance.
3. **`welldotPt`** (`packages/vue/src/theme/pt.ts`) — pass-through for structural/utility tweaks (Tailwind class or HTML attr on an internal element). One-off layout adjustments only; not for color changes.
4. **Custom component** — last resort, only when the three layers above are genuinely insufficient.

Never target PrimeVue internal class names in scoped CSS — they're unstable across minor versions. Use pass-through instead.

Use `severity` props (`"primary"`, `"success"`, `"warn"`, `"danger"`, `"info"`) on PrimeVue components rather than manually applying color classes. The theme maps severities to the semantic scales automatically.

## Constraints

- `@welldot/render` uses D3 and mutates the DOM — wrap renderer calls in `onMounted` or `<ClientOnly>`.
- SSR is enabled; avoid `window`/`document` access outside of client lifecycle hooks or `process.client` guards.
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers (Nitro `cloudflare-module` preset) — no Node.js server runtime. All server routes must be Cloudflare/workerd-compatible.
- **Icons:** Use Phosphor (`ph:`) for all new UI. Prefer the **duotone** variant (`ph:icon-name-duotone`) as the default — it matches the editorial aesthetic. Fall back to `ph:icon-name` (regular) only when duotone is unavailable. Browse at https://icones.js.org/collection/ph. Do not use Heroicons in new components; the landing page (`layouts/landing.vue`) may keep its existing `heroicons:` usage.
- **Tailwind canonical classes only** — no arbitrary values (`w-[37px]`, `bg-[#eef0f3]`, `text-[14px]`). Use the design-token utilities (`bg-surface-*`, `text-content-*`, spacing scale, etc.) or standard Tailwind scale values. Arbitrary values bypass the token system, don't respond to mode changes, and make refactoring the theme harder.
