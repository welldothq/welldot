# Welldot (fka Well Profiler)

## Overview

Most software for documenting and visualizing water well profiles is proprietary, expensive, and not interoperable. Well Profiler exists to change that.

This repository started as **Well Profiler**, a tool focused on drawing well diagrams. It has since grown into **welldot**, a broader open-source ecosystem for geological well log visualization and profiling, designed for hydrogeologists, engineers, and researchers — spanning not just drawing, but also structured data recording and research. It consists of a web application and a set of reusable TypeScript libraries built around the **`.well` open file format**.

The core tools — the Well Profiler app, the `.well` format, and the libraries — are free and open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

You can try the app at [welldot.org](https://welldot.org). Documentation lives at [docs.welldot.org](https://docs.welldot.org). The source lives at [github.com/welldothq/welldot](https://github.com/welldothq/welldot).

This README covers the `.well` format at a glance, the published packages, the app's features, how to run the repository locally, the tech stack and the roadmap.

## The `.well` File Format

The core of this project is an open, versioned file format for water well data — not just the app.

The `.well` format is designed to serve three purposes:

- **Visualization** — enough constructive and geological detail to produce accurate well profile drawings at true depth scale
- **Registration** — a complete static record suitable for regulatory submissions and national well registries
- **Research** — structured data aligned with FGDC and hydrogeological standards, enabling cross-well analysis and aquifer characterization

The format is human-readable JSON with full, descriptive key names. It is easy to inspect, diff, and version-control without tooling.

**Example `.well` file (v2.4):**

## Packages

This monorepo publishes three standalone npm packages:

### [`@welldot/core`](./packages/core)

Types, Zod validators, and serialization utilities for the `.well` format. The foundation for all other packages.

```bash
npm install @welldot/core
```

### [`@welldot/render`](./packages/render)

D3-based SVG renderer for `.well` profiles. This is the visualization engine used by Well Profiler — available as a standalone library so you can embed well profile diagrams in any web application.

```bash
npm install @welldot/render
```

### [`@welldot/utils`](./packages/utils)

Profile analysis utilities: depth calculations, cylindrical volumes, gravel pack volume estimates, and construction data summaries.

```bash
npm install @welldot/utils
```

---

## App Features

The editor at [welldot.org](https://welldot.org) covers the full `.well` v2 schema:

- **Live profile canvas** — borehole geometry, surface casing, casing and screen strings, reducers, annular space, wellhead, lithological column, fractures, and caves, rendered as you type, with pan and zoom
- **Construction data** — borehole, surface casing, casing, screen, reduction, hole fill, and wellhead sections in editable data grids
- **Geology** — lithology by geologic unit, plus fractures and caves, with FGDC texture pickers
- **Hydrodynamic events** — constant-rate, step-drawdown, airlift, and recovery pumping tests with time-series readings and derived aquifer statistics
- **History log** — timestamped maintenance, inspection, and incident records with attachments
- **Well identity and location** — multi-registry `well_id` entries and a map-based location picker with elevation
- **Summary and volumes** — depth, layer, and screen KPIs plus per-section tables with grout and pre-filter volumes for cost estimation
- **Open and save** — native file handles where the File System Access API is available, with `Cmd/Ctrl+S` and unsaved-change guards
- **Shareable links** — publish a profile with per-section visibility control
- **Printable PDF reports** — configurable sections and info items
- **Preferences** — length (m / ft) and diameter (mm / in) units, coordinate format, light/dark theme, and EN / PT interface

---

## Getting Started

To run the Well Profiler app locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts every workspace at once: the active Nuxt app on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), the deprecated Next.js app on
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and `tsup --watch` for the three libraries. To run just the
active app, use `pnpm turbo dev --filter=profiler`.

To use the libraries in your own project, install them individually — see the README in each package for usage details.

---

## Tech Stack

- [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com/) + [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — active web app (`apps/profiler`, deployed at welldot.org)
- [PrimeVue 4](https://primevue.org/) + [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) — UI components and styling
- [`@welldot/render`](./packages/render) — SVG profile rendering (built on [D3.js](https://d3js.org/))
- [pdfmake](http://pdfmake.org/) — PDF export
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) — state management

---

## Geologic Symbolization

Well Profiler uses the [FGDC Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic Map Symbolization](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd/download.php), specifically the [FGDC Pattern Chart](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd/fgdc-geolsym-patternchart.pdf) to represent lithological textures, the same standard used in scientific literature.

## Roadmap

### `.well` format — v2 shipped

The following were delivered in `.well` v2.0 (shipped in `@welldot/core` v0.2.0):

- **Pumping tests** — constant-rate, step-drawdown, airlift, and recovery-only event types with full time-series readings
- **Aquifer analysis** — transmissivity, specific capacity, storativity, hydraulic conductivity, and Jacob loss coefficients with method and analyst attribution
- **Operational history log** — timestamped records of maintenance, inspections, and incidents with HTTPS attachment references
- **Structured location** — `location` object with explicit CRS, elevation datum, and one-sigma precision fields
- **Registry identifiers** — `well_id[]` array linking a well to multiple national and institutional registries

The v2.3 revision (shipped in `@welldot/core` v0.4.0) adds the operational blocks and water quality:

- **Pump installations** — installation history with nameplate, intake depth, riser and electrical data; the current pump is drawn on the profile
- **Permits** — outorgas with validity, granted flow, daily operating time and volumes, and conditions (condicionantes) whose deadlines are derived from ISO 8601 date durations and whose fulfillments are recorded on the condition; an administrative status (requested, suspended, revoked…) and an administrative history (filing, notifications, fees)
- **Meters and production** — totalizer installation history plus a production ledger of meter readings and declared volumes; volumes are derived with rollover handling and are never stored as totals
- **Operating regime** — declared flow rate, daily operating time and days per week, each entry in force from `effective_from`
- **Structured history logs** — `maintenance` entries reference the pump, meter or event they concern (`maintenance_type`, `pump_installation_id`, `meter_id`, `event_id`); the new `status_change` category records the well's operating status
- **Attachments** — a root-level `attachments` array for general files about the well (e.g. the drilling report), plus `document_type` and per-record attachments on log entries, permits (and their history steps and condition fulfillments), pumps, meters, hydrodynamic events, aquifer analyses and water samples. The root array does not collect the per-record attachments
- **Water quality** — a `water_samples` ledger: each sample carries its field and laboratory results, sampling point and depth, purge and stabilization readings, laboratory and chain of custody, field QA/QC (duplicates, splits, blanks), filtration, lab flags and data validation. Parameters use a versioned vocabulary of 98 `welldot` codes plus CAS numbers, with units fixed by code. Limits stay out of the file: WHO, EU and Brazilian limit sets ship as data in `@welldot/core`
- **Ledger corrections** — `hydrodynamic_events[].corrects`, `production[].corrects` and `water_samples[].corrects` retract an erroneous entry without editing it

The v2.4 revision (shipped in `@welldot/core` v0.5.0) changes how a file declares its version and adds continuous level series. Parsers up to `@welldot/core` 0.4.0 reject v2.4 files:

- **Version as a string** — files write `"version": "2.4"`; readers also accept the integer `1` and `2`
- **Time zone** — `location.properties.timezone` (IANA) fixes the local date of an instant, so permit deadlines no longer change with the offset a tool writes
- **Logger series** — the `logger_series` event type for datalogger exports, with `LevelReading.datetime`
- **Offline packaging** — an optional `.wellz` ZIP with the `.well` file and its attachments, for regulators and archiving
- **Clearer rules** — optional fields are omitted, never `null`; ledgers may be edited in place; repeated records merge by `id`; unresolved references survive re-export; known event types are validated against their own schema

### `.well` format — future versions

- **Interpreted water quality assessment** — stored judgments such as water class or hydrochemical facies (today they are derived on demand)
- **Geophysical logs** — downhole resistivity, gamma ray, and caliper surveys (reserved for v3)
- **Multi-well linking** — observation well references for storativity determination (reserved for v3)

### Ecosystem

- **`.LAS` file import** — support for the industry-standard Log ASCII Standard format used in oil, gas, and water-well logging
- **Locale-aware dates** — dates still render ISO-style; numbers and units are already localized and switchable

## Claude Code Skill — `welldot-converter`

The `welldot-converter` skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) converts any water well report (PDF, DOCX, image, or plain text) into a valid `.well` JSON file. It works with reports in any language (Portuguese, English, Spanish, etc.) and uses the official welldot spec as its source of truth.

**What it does:**

- Extracts all well data from a report — construction, lithology, fractures, caves, and more
- Validates output against the `.well` format spec
- Preserves the source document's language in all free-text fields
- Flags fields that were absent in the report rather than guessing values

**Install:**

The skill lives at `.agents/skills/welldot-converter/`, the vendor-neutral path that every
skills-capable client discovers. `.claude/skills/welldot-converter` is a symlink to it, kept for
back-compat. If you cloned the repo, the skill is already available project-locally.

To make it available globally across all your projects, copy the real directory — not the symlink —
into your personal skills directory:

```bash
cp -R .agents/skills/welldot-converter ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Use:**

Open Claude Code in any project and run:

```
/welldot-converter
```

Then attach or describe the well report you want to convert. Claude will extract the data, validate it, and produce a `.well` file ready for upload to [welldot.org](https://welldot.org) or use with `@welldot/core`.

If you are building a tool that reads or writes `.well` files, you don't need permission and you
don't need to use these libraries — the format is open and the spec is complete enough to implement
from scratch. Please open an issue to tell us about it; we want to keep a list of compatible
implementations.
