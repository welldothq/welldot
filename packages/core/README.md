## Overview

TypeScript types, Zod validators, and serialization utilities for the `.well` open format — a JSON-based standard for representing water well data.

This README covers installation, a quick start, the API (types, validators, functions and unit conversion), the water quality and recommended vocabularies, the FGDC texture codes and a short tour of the format. The normative specification lives in [spec/v2](https://docs.welldot.org/format/spec/v2/overview).

## What is `.well`?

`.well` is an open file format for encoding the complete record of a water well as a single, self-describing JSON document. A `.well` file contains:

- **Constructive data** — borehole geometry, casing strings, screens, reducers, gravel packs, centralizers, and cement pads
- **Geologic data** — lithological column, discrete fractures, and cave zones
- **Administrative metadata** — well identity, construction type and purpose (`well_type`, `well_purpose`), authority-scoped IDs (`well_id`), driller, construction date, and geographic coordinates with explicit CRS
- **Hydrodynamic events** — ledger of static level readings, pumping tests (constant-rate, step-drawdown, airlift), and recovery phases
- **Aquifer analysis** — interpreted parameter sets: transmissivity, specific capacity, storativity, and Jacob loss coefficients
- **Operational history** — timestamped log of maintenance, inspections, incidents, status changes and permit condition fulfillment, with HTTPS attachment references
- **Pump installations** — installation history of the well's pumps: nameplate data, intake depth, riser and electrical data (v2.3)
- **Permits** — legal instruments governing abstraction (outorgas): validity, granted flow and daily operating time, volume limits, monthly schedule, and conditions (condicionantes) whose deadlines are derived from ISO 8601 date durations, with their fulfillments, an administrative status (requested, suspended…) and an administrative history (v2.3)
- **Meters, production and operating regime** — totalizer (hidrômetro) installation history, a production ledger of meter readings and declared volumes (volumes are derived, never stored as totals), and the declared operating regime in force from a given instant (v2.3)
- **Water quality** — a `water_samples` ledger of samples, each with its field and laboratory results, sampling point and depth, purge and stabilization readings, laboratory and chain of custody, field QA/QC (duplicates, splits, blanks), per-result filtration, lab flags and data validation. Parameters are identified by `{ code, vocabulary }` against a versioned vocabulary of 98 `welldot` codes (plus CAS numbers and `x-` codes), and units come from the code. Limits are never stored in the file (v2.3)
- **Attachments** — HTTPS-referenced files typed by `document_type`: a root-level `attachments` array for general files about the well (e.g. the drilling report), plus per-record attachments on log entries, permits (and their history steps and condition fulfillments), pumps, meters, events, analyses and water samples. The root array does not collect the per-record ones (v2.3)

The format is designed for three use cases: visualization of technical well profiles, registration with regulatory bodies, and hydrogeological research.

See the [v2 format specification](https://docs.welldot.org/format/spec/v2/overview) (current revision: v2.4) for the complete schema reference and design rationale. The [v1 spec](https://docs.welldot.org/format/spec/v1/well-format) remains available for reference.

The JSON Schema ships with the package as `@welldot/core/well.schema.json` and is published at `https://welldot.org/schema/v2/well.schema.json`.

### Example wells

The package ships 14 complete, valid `.well` files in [`examples/`](./examples/README.md). They are built on real wells from the Brazilian SIAGAS registry, with illustrative names, permits, analyses and operating data. Together they cover crystalline, karst, sedimentary, deep, flowing, hand-dug and monitoring wells, plus incomplete and inconsistent records. Import them as `@welldot/core/examples/<file>`, or download them from `https://welldot.org/examples/<file>`.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @welldot/core

# pnpm
pnpm add @welldot/core

# yarn
yarn add @welldot/core
```

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 18. [`zod`](https://zod.dev) is bundled as a dependency.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import type { Well, BoreHole, Lithology } from '@welldot/core';
import {
  WellSchema,
  parseWell,
  serializeWell,
  deserializeWell,
  hasWellData,
  isWellEmpty,
} from '@welldot/core';

// Parse and validate a .well JSON string — throws ZodError on invalid input
const well = parseWell(rawJsonString);

// Validate an existing object with the Zod schema directly
const result = WellSchema.safeParse(unknownData);

// Serialize a Well object to a versioned JSON string
const jsonString = serializeWell(well);

// Deserialize — handles versioned format and legacy formats
const restored = deserializeWell(jsonString);

// Check if a well has a profile to draw, or holds any data at all
const empty = isWellEmpty(well);
const hasData = hasWellData(well);
```

### Validators

Each schema validates its corresponding type at runtime. All schemas are Zod objects and compose with standard Zod methods (`.parse`, `.safeParse`, `.extend`, etc.).

### Functions

#### `parseWell(json: string): Well`

Parses a raw JSON string and validates it against `WellSchema`. Throws a `ZodError` on validation failure. Unknown members (`x-` fields and blocks) are kept at every level, including inside array items. Does not handle legacy formats — use `deserializeWell` for that.

#### `serializeWell(well: Well): string`

Serializes a `Well` object to a versioned `.well` JSON string (`"version": "2.4"`, `WELL_FORMAT_VERSION`). Omits `null` members outside `x-` fields and `@context`. Emits `location` when set; does not emit deprecated flat `lat`/`lng`/`elevation` or other legacy v1 keys. Omits `undefined` optional fields. Root members the spec does not define (`x-` fields and blocks, foreign members) are written unchanged after the spec blocks, as the spec requires.

#### `deserializeWell(jsonString: string): Well | null`

Parses and normalizes a JSON string into a `Well`. Handles multiple formats:

- v2 format (`"version": "2.x"`, or the integer `2` written before v2.4) — passes v2-specific fields through directly
- v1 format (`"version": 1`) — applies v1→v2 normalizations: `fgdc_texture` → `texture`, `screen_slot_mm` → `screen_slot`, flat `lat/lng/elevation` → `location`
- Legacy formats with `constructive` / `geologic` sub-objects
- Legacy `diam_pol` inch diameters → `diameter` mm conversion (`× 25.4`)
- Typo `bole_hole` → `bore_hole` compatibility

Returns `null` if the parsed data is empty. Throws on unrecognized version numbers.

#### Format version and time zone _(v2.4)_

| Export                                | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WELL_FORMAT_VERSION`                 | The version `serializeWell` writes: `"2.4"`.                                                                                      |
| `parseFormatVersion(value)`           | Parses `2` or `"M.m"` into a `FormatVersion` (`{ major, minor }`); `undefined` for `2.4`, `"2.4.1"`, `"v2.4"` and other values.   |
| `compareFormatVersions(a, b)`         | Compares two `"M.m"` strings as two integers (`"2.10"` is after `"2.9"`); throws on malformed input.                              |
| `isIanaTimeZone(value)`               | Whether `value` is an IANA time zone name (`America/Belem`), for `location.properties.timezone`. Offsets are not valid.           |
| `LoggerSeriesEvent` / `LoggerReading` | Types of the `logger_series` hydrodynamic event and its readings; validated by `LoggerSeriesEventSchema` / `LoggerReadingSchema`. |

#### `isWellEmpty(well: Well | null | undefined): boolean`

Returns `true` when all constructive and geologic arrays are empty. Accepts `null` and `undefined` (both treated as empty).

#### `hasWellData(well: Well | null | undefined): boolean`

Returns `true` when the well holds any data: a profile, or any other filled root member (identification, location, events, samples, permits, `x-` members, …). A registry record without construction or geology has data although `isWellEmpty` says it has nothing to draw. Blank strings, zeros and objects holding only those do not count.

#### `calculatedWellDepth(well: Well): number`

Deepest `to` across the constructive arrays (bore hole, casings, screens, reductions, hole fill), ignoring geology. `0` without constructive data. Used as the fallback for a missing `well_depth`.

#### `redactWell(well: Well, visibility: WellVisibility): Well`

Copy of `well` with hidden parts emptied (arrays become `[]`, optional fields are removed), so the result stays schema-valid. `visibility` keys are the 7 `SECTION_KEYS` and/or the fields of `VISIBILITY_TREE` (e.g. `meters`, `permits`, `location`); `false` hides, missing keys are visible, and a hidden section hides all its fields. `VISIBILITY_LEAF_KEYS` lists the finest toggles. References from visible records to hidden ones are left as-is. Unknown root members (`x-` fields and blocks) are kept only when nothing is hidden; nested ones follow their record.

```typescript
redactWell(well, { operation: false }); // whole section
redactWell(well, { meters: false, location: false }); // single fields
```

#### Unit conversion

`.well` files always store canonical SI units; these helpers convert for display and input.

## Water Quality Vocabulary and Limit Sets _(v2.3)_

The `welldot` water quality parameter vocabulary is published as versioned data. Each `ParameterDefinition` carries the code, group, canonical English label, translations (`labels.pt`), canonical unit (display symbol and UCUM code), value form (`value`, `presence` or `text`), the CAS equivalence when one exists, and molar mass and charge for ions used in ion balance and hydrochemical diagrams.

| `NEPHELOMETRIC_TURBIDITY_CODES`    | `turbidity`, `turbidity_ntu`, `turbidity_fnu` — compared with nephelometric limits; `turbidity_fau` never is        |

  getLimitSet,
  getParameterDefinition,
  parameterKey,
} from '@welldot/core';

getParameterDefinition({ code: '14808-79-8', vocabulary: 'cas' })?.code; // 'sulfate'
parameterKey({ code: 'sulfate', vocabulary: 'welldot' }); // 'sulfate'
getLimitSet('who_gdwq_2022')?.limits.find(l => l.code === 'arsenic');
```

Limits are never written to `.well` files (jurisdiction neutrality): consumers pick a set at display time and compare results with the derivation helpers of `@welldot/utils`. **The bundled limit values are transcribed from the cited sources and must be verified against the official documents before any regulatory use.**

## Recommended Vocabularies _(v2.3)_

Many `.well` string fields are **open**: any value (or an `x-` extension) is valid, but the spec recommends a vocabulary. Each one is exported as data, with display labels keyed by BCP 47 language tag (`en` and `pt` always present). Field types use `OpenVocab<T>` (`T | (string & {})`), so the recommended values autocomplete while any string still type-checks.

| Vocabulary                                                                     | Field                                                                                               |

Labels are `LanguageText<'en' | 'pt'>`. `LanguageText<L>` is the general localized-text type (`Record<string, string>` keyed by BCP 47 tag), where `L` lists the tags that must be present — `LanguageText` alone requires none. `LanguageTextInput` adds the plain-string, JSON-string and `null`/`undefined` forms accepted by `resolveLanguageText`.

### Closed vocabularies

Fields whose values the schema fixes (no free text, no `x-`) ship in the same shape as the open vocabularies — `VocabEntry` lists with `en`/`pt` labels — so `getVocabLabel` labels any value without consumer translations. Each list is checked at compile time against its type, so it cannot drift from the schema. The `*_VALUES` lists are the bare values.

| Vocabulary                                                    | Field                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `WELL_STATUSES` (`WELL_STATUS_VALUES`)                        | `history_logs[].status` (`status_change`)     |
| `PERMIT_ADMINISTRATIVE_STATUSES`                              | `permits[].status`                            |

| `RESULT_QUALIFIERS` (`QUALIFIER_VALUES`)                      | result `qualifier`                            |
| `RESULT_FRACTIONS` (`FRACTION_VALUES`)                        | result `fraction`                             |
| `MEASUREMENT_LOCATIONS`                                       | result `measured_in`, `filtration.location`   |
| `VALIDATION_STATUSES` (`VALIDATION_STATUS_VALUES`)            | result `validation.status`                    |
| `PARAMETER_GROUPS` (`PARAMETER_GROUP_VALUES`)                 | parameter vocabulary groups, in display order |
| `BAROMETRIC_COMPENSATIONS` (`BAROMETRIC_COMPENSATION_VALUES`) | `logger_series.barometric_compensation`       |
| `READING_AGGREGATIONS` (`READING_AGGREGATION_VALUES`)         | `logger_series.aggregation`                   |

Value rules without labels: `NUMERIC_QUALIFIERS`, `PARENT_SAMPLE_TYPES`, `BLANK_SAMPLE_TYPES`. Parameter names: `getParameterLabel(parameter, locale)` (CAS numbers resolve through the published equivalences; unknown codes are returned as-is).

## FGDC Texture Patterns

`FGDC_TEXTURES_OPTIONS` is a typed array of 284 texture pattern entries drawn from the **FGDC Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic Map Symbolization (FGDC-STD-013-2006)**. Assign a `code` to the `texture` field of a `Lithology` record to attach a standardized fill pattern to a depth interval.

```typescript
import { FGDC_TEXTURES_OPTIONS } from '@welldot/core';
import type { Texture, TextureCode } from '@welldot/core';

// Lookup by code
const sandstone = FGDC_TEXTURES_OPTIONS.find(t => t.code === 607);
// { code: 607, label: 'Massive sand or sandstone' }

// Build a select list for a UI
const options = FGDC_TEXTURES_OPTIONS.map(t => ({
  value: t.code,
  label: t.label,
}));

Codes are grouped by series:

| Series | Category                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 100    | Surficial deposits                                     |
| 200    | Sedimentary patterns                                   |
| 300    | Igneous patterns                                       |
| 400    | Miscellaneous / Metamorphic patterns                   |
| 500    | Glacial / Periglacial patterns                         |
| 600    | Sedimentary lithology _(most useful for well logging)_ |
| 700    | Metamorphic and igneous lithology                      |

## `.well` Format Overview

All depths are in **meters** from ground level (0 = surface). All diameters are in **millimeters**. Geographic coordinates use WGS84 decimal degrees. The MIME type is `application/vnd.well+json`.

A minimal v2.4 `.well` document:

```json
